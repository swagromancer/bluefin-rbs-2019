# Build Scripts

This directory contains build scripts that run during image creation. Scripts are executed in numerical order.

## How It Works

Scripts are named with a number prefix (e.g., `10-build.sh`, `20-onepassword.sh`) and run in ascending order during the container build process.

## Creating Your Own Scripts

Create numbered scripts for different purposes:

```bash
# 10-build.sh - Base system (already exists)
# 20-drivers.sh - Hardware drivers  
# 30-development.sh - Development tools
# 40-gaming.sh - Gaming software
# 50-cleanup.sh - Final cleanup tasks
```

### Script Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

set -eoux pipefail

###############################################################################
# {WHAT} Script
###############################################################################
# {DESCRIPTION}
#
# This script follows the @ublue-os/bluefin pattern for build scripts.
# It uses set -eoux pipefail for strict error handling and debugging.
###############################################################################

echo "Running custom setup..."

# Your commands here

echo "Custom setup ran successfully"
```

### Best Practices

- **Use descriptive names**: `20-nvidia-drivers.sh` is better than `20-stuff.sh`
- **One purpose per script**: Easier to debug and maintain
- **Clean up after yourself**: Remove temporary files and disable temporary repos
- **Test incrementally**: Add one script at a time and test builds
- **Comment your code**: Future you will thank present you

### Disabling Scripts

To temporarily disable a script without deleting it:
- Rename it with `.disabled` extension: `20-script.sh.disabled`
- Or remove execute permission: `chmod -x build/20-script.sh`

## Execution Order

The Containerfile runs scripts like this:

```dockerfile
RUN /ctx/build/build.sh
```

If you want to run multiple scripts, you can:

1. **Modify Containerfile** to run each script explicitly
2. **Create a runner script** that executes all numbered scripts
3. **Use the default** and keep everything in `10-build.sh` (simplest)

## Notes

- Scripts run as root during build
- Build context is available at `/ctx`
- Use dnf5 for package management (not dnf or yum)
- Always use `-y` flag for non-interactive installs
